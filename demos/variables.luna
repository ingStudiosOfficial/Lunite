~~ this is how you make vars in Lunite:
let a = 4
let b = 2
let c = "Hello, World!"

~~ this is a constant value, which cannot be changed
let const pi = 3.1415926

let d = a * b
out(c)
out(d)
out(pi)

attempt {
    pi = 4; ~~ this will not work
} rescue(e) {
    out("Exception caught: " + str(e))
}
